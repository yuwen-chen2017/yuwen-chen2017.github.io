# The equation for a relativistic damped oscillator 
## A general asymptotic method( Raimond A. Struble:Nonlinear differential equations)
### consider the Mathieu equation

  $$ 
   u_{xx}\omega^2 u=\varepsilon u\cos(x) 
  $$
   
 For $\varepsilon=0 $, the solution are the uniformly bounded, simple harmonic functions of period $\frac{1}{2\pi}$.  In general, the solution are either almost periodic , or diverging or decaying oscillations.
